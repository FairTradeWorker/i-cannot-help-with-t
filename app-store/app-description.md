💰 **THE FAIR TRADE DIFFERENCE**
Traditional platforms charge workers 15-30% of every job. That's money taken from hardworking contractors and passed to shareholders. FairTradeWorker flips this model:

• Homeowners pay the project cost
• 92% goes directly to workers
• 8% funds local territory operators
• Workers NEVER pay platform fees

This creates a sustainable ecosystem where the best contractors thrive, homeowners get fair prices, and communities benefit from local economic activity.
