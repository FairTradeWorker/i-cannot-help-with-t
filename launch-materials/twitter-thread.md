## Thread: 15 Tweets on Fair Trade + AI in Home Services

---

**Tweet 1 (Hook)**
I spent 15 years as a contractor watching platforms steal 20-30% of every paycheck.

So I learned to code and built an alternative.

Today we're launching FairTradeWorker: AI APIs where workers pay $0 fees.

Here's the full story 🧵

---

**Tweet 2 (The Problem)**
The home services industry is broken.

Thumbtack charges $20-60 PER LEAD (not even a job).
HomeAdvisor takes 15-25% of every project.
Angi charges commission + subscription + lead fees.

Contractors are getting squeezed from every angle.

---

**Tweet 3 (The Human Cost)**
When I was roofing, I watched good contractors leave the industry.

Not because they couldn't do the work—but because after platform fees, insurance, materials, and labor... there was nothing left.

Meanwhile, platforms reported record profits.

---

**Tweet 4 (The Question)**
I kept asking: Why do platforms need to take so much from workers?

The answer: They don't.

It's just easier to extract from a fragmented workforce than to build sustainable economics.

So we designed something different.

---

**Tweet 5 (The Model)**
FairTradeWorker's Fair Trade model:

• Homeowners pay project cost
• 92% goes directly to workers
• 8% goes to territory operators (local quality control)
• Platform funded by API subscriptions

Workers pay $0. Forever.

---

**Tweet 6 (Why It Works)**
"But how do you make money?"

B2B API subscriptions:
- Contractors: Free tier → $97/mo pro
- Home service platforms: Enterprise APIs
- PE firms: Market intelligence
- Insurance: Risk assessment

We monetize businesses, not workers.

---

**Tweet 7 (The AI)**
But fair economics isn't enough. We also built something technically impressive:

50+ Intelligence APIs that learn from every call.

Job analysis. Instant quotes. Contractor matching. Demand forecasting.

And they get smarter over time.

---

**Tweet 8 (Learning Loop)**
The magic is our learning loop:

1. API returns a prediction (e.g., quote)
2. Job gets completed
3. Actual outcome feeds back
4. Model improves
5. Next prediction is more accurate

We started at 82% accuracy. Now at 97%.

---

**Tweet 9 (Technical Innovation)**
How we analyze job photos:

1. Vision model identifies damage/scope
2. Material estimator calculates quantities
3. Labor model predicts hours by trade
4. Pricing engine applies local rates
5. Quote generated in <2 seconds

From photo → quote in 60 seconds.

---

**Tweet 10 (Scale)**
Today our APIs process:

• 2M+ job predictions
• 500+ active customers
• 50 states covered
• 99.2% average accuracy
• 99.9% uptime

And every call makes the system smarter.

---

**Tweet 11 (For Developers)**
If you're building a home services app:

Free tier: 100 API calls/month
Pro: $97/mo → 10,000 calls
Enterprise: $497/mo → Unlimited

Full REST API. SDKs for JS, Python. OpenAPI spec. Postman collection.

Ship faster. Let us handle the intelligence.

---

**Tweet 12 (For Contractors)**
If you're a contractor:

• Zero platform fees
• Instant quote tool
• Route optimization
• Performance analytics
• Keep your customer relationships

You've been paying too much for too long. Try something different.

---

**Tweet 13 (The Vision)**
Our vision:

Every contractor has access to AI tools that were previously enterprise-only.

Every homeowner gets fair, transparent pricing.

Every platform can integrate intelligence without building from scratch.

Fair trade + AI = everyone wins.
