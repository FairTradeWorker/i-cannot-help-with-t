# Cold Email Templates for Roofing & Contractor Companies

## Email Template 1: Direct Value Proposition

**Subject:** Cut your lead costs by 100% (not a typo)

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

I noticed {{company_name}} is listed on Thumbtack and HomeAdvisor. Quick question: how much are you paying per lead? $30? $50? More?

What if I told you there's a platform where you pay $0 in lead fees or commissions?

I'm Alex, founder of FairTradeWorker. I spent 15 years as a roofing contractor before building this platform. I know exactly what it feels like to watch 20% of every paycheck disappear to platform fees.

Here's how we're different:
• You keep 92% of every job (8% goes to local quality assurance)
• Zero lead fees, zero commissions, zero hidden charges
• AI-powered instant quotes to help you close faster

500+ contractors have already switched. Average savings: $14,400/year.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see if this fits your business?

Best,

P.S. - Reply "DEMO" and I'll send you a personalized analysis of what you'd save annually.

## Email Template 2: Competitor Comparison

**Subject:** Thumbtack fees are eating your profits (there's an alternative)

**Body:**

{{first_name}},

Real talk: I ran a roofing crew for 15 years. The day I calculated how much I'd paid Thumbtack over 3 years, I almost threw my phone.

$47,000. Gone.

That money should have gone to my guys. Instead, it funded some VC's beach house.

So I built FairTradeWorker—a platform designed BY a contractor, FOR contractors.

**The difference:**
| | Thumbtack | FairTradeWorker |
|---|---|---|
| Lead fee | $20-60 | $0 |
| Commission | Up to 20% | 0% |
| You keep | ~80% | 92% |

We make money from API subscriptions (businesses pay us, not workers). You keep what you earn.

I'd love to show you how {{company_name}} could save $10K+ annually.

## Email Template 3: Pain Point Focus

**Subject:** The real cost of HomeAdvisor leads

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

Here's a frustrating math problem:

• You pay $40 for a HomeAdvisor lead
• 3 other contractors got the same lead
• Homeowner goes with the cheapest bid
• You're out $40 with nothing to show for it

Multiply that by 100 leads a year, and you've burned $4,000 chasing customers who never hired you.

What if you only paid when you actually got the job?

At FairTradeWorker, there are no lead fees. Period.

Homeowners find you through our AI-matching system. When they choose you, you keep 92% of the job. No upfront costs, no surprise deductions.

I'm a former contractor (15 years in roofing). I built this because I lived this frustration.

Want to see how it works for {{city}} roofers?

Reply "YES" and I'll set up a quick demo.

## Email Template 4: Social Proof

**Subject:** How Austin roofers are saving $15K/year

**Body:**

{{first_name}},

Mike Rodriguez switched from Thumbtack to FairTradeWorker 8 months ago.

His results:
• Lead costs: $4,800/year → $0
• Jobs closed: 23% more (faster quotes)
• Take-home: $15,200 more in his pocket

"I wish I'd found this years ago. The AI quotes are scary accurate, and I actually keep what I earn." — Mike R., Rodriguez Roofing

Mike's story isn't unique. 500+ contractors across {{state}} have made the switch.

Here's what makes us different:
✓ Zero platform fees (you keep 92%)
✓ AI-powered instant quotes (close faster)
✓ No competing for shared leads

{{company_name}} could be next.

Open to a 10-minute call this week?

## Email Template 5: Question-Based

**Subject:** Quick question about {{company_name}}'s lead generation

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick question: If you could eliminate 100% of your platform fees overnight, what would you do with the extra $10-15K per year?

• New equipment?
• Better pay for your crew?
• Just... keep it?

I ask because that's exactly what FairTradeWorker offers contractors like {{company_name}}.

We're a platform where:
• Workers pay $0 in fees (seriously)
• AI generates instant quotes from job photos
• Homeowners find you through smart matching

I was a contractor for 15 years before building this. I know the fee game is rigged against us.

We're changing it.

## Email Template 6: Story-Based

**Subject:** Why I quit roofing to build software

**Body:**

{{first_name}},

In 2019, I sat down and calculated how much I'd paid to lead generation platforms over my 15-year roofing career.

The number was $127,000.

Not to employees. Not to materials. To PLATFORMS for the privilege of connecting with customers who already needed my services.

I sold my business and spent 3 years building something different: FairTradeWorker.

The concept is simple: Workers should keep what they earn.

Here's how it works:
• Homeowners pay for the job
• You get 92% (8% goes to local territory operators)
• Platform is funded by API subscriptions (not your money)

No lead fees. No commissions. No hidden catches.

I know you're probably skeptical—I would be too. But 500 contractors have already made the switch.

Could I show you what {{company_name}} would save in a quick call?

## Email Template 7: ROI Focus

**Subject:** Your {{company_name}} ROI analysis

**Body:**

{{first_name}},

I did some quick math on {{company_name}}:

Based on typical {{city}} roofers with your Google review volume, you're probably spending:
• $3,600-6,000/year on Thumbtack leads
• $2,400-4,800/year on HomeAdvisor
• Plus 10-20% commissions on jobs from platforms

Total platform costs: $8,000-15,000/year

With FairTradeWorker, that number drops to: **$0**

You'd keep 92% of every job. Zero lead fees. Zero commissions.

Over 5 years, that's $40,000-75,000 back in your pocket.

Skeptical? I would be too. That's why I offer a free trial with zero risk.

Want me to run a real analysis for {{company_name}}?

## Email Template 8: Urgency

**Subject:** 47 {{city}} contractors switched this month

**Body:**

{{first_name}},

Something interesting is happening in {{city}}.

This month alone, 47 local contractors canceled their Thumbtack and HomeAdvisor accounts to join FairTradeWorker.

Why the exodus?

Simple: They realized they were paying $10,000+ per year in fees they didn't need to pay.

Our platform charges workers $0. Not reduced fees. Zero.

Every month you wait is another $800-1,200 in fees that should be in your pocket.

I'd love to get {{company_name}} set up before the next wave of jobs comes in.

10-minute call to see if it's a fit?

## Email Template 9: Objection Handling

**Subject:** "Free sounds too good to be true" — I get it

**Body:**

{{first_name}},

I know what you're thinking: "Free for contractors? What's the catch?"

Fair question. Here's the honest answer:

We make money from API subscriptions. Businesses—like property management companies, insurance firms, and real estate platforms—pay us $97-497/month to use our Intelligence APIs.

Workers never pay. It's in our company charter.

Why? Because I was a contractor for 15 years. I've paid Thumbtack, HomeAdvisor, and Angi more than I care to admit. Building a platform that extracts from workers just felt... wrong.

So we built the opposite.

• You keep 92% of every job
• 8% goes to local territory operators (not us)
• AI tools to quote faster and close more

The catch? There isn't one.

But I understand if you want to see it work before believing it. Reply "DEMO" and I'll set up a quick walkthrough.

## Email Template 10: Follow-Up #1

**Subject:** Re: {{previous_subject}}

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

Just bumping this up—I know you're busy running jobs.

The short version: FairTradeWorker = zero fees for contractors.

If {{company_name}} is paying Thumbtack/HomeAdvisor right now, you're probably leaving $10K+ per year on the table.

Worth a 10-minute call to explore?

## Email Template 11: Follow-Up #2 (Break-Up)

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

**Body:**

{{first_name}},

I've reached out a couple times about eliminating your lead generation fees—no response.

No worries at all. But I want to make sure I'm not wasting your time.

If you're:
• Happy with your current platform fees, I'll stop reaching out
• Too busy right now, I can follow up in 3 months
• Actually interested, let's find 10 minutes this week

Just reply with a number (1, 2, or 3) and I'll take it from there.

Either way, best of luck with {{company_name}}!

## Best Practices for Cold Outreach

1. **Personalization is key** - Use company name, city, industry specifics
2. **Send Monday-Thursday, 8-10 AM** local time
3. **Follow-up sequence**: Day 1 → Day 4 → Day 8 → Day 15
4. **Track open rates** - Subject lines with numbers perform 28% better
5. **A/B test** everything - especially subject lines
6. **Avoid spam triggers** - "FREE!!!" is bad, "zero fees" is okay
7. **Include unsubscribe** - CAN-SPAM compliance
8. **Warm up domain** - Start with 20 emails/day, scale gradually
