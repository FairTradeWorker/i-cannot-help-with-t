## Title
FairTradeWorker - AI APIs That Learn, Built for Fair Trade

## Tagline (60 chars max)
Self-learning Intelligence APIs for home services. $97/mo.

## Description

**TL;DR: 50+ APIs that get smarter with every call. Workers pay zero fees.**

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I spent 15 years as a contractor before learning to code. The home services industry is broken—platforms charge workers 15-30% of every job, and technology that could help is locked behind enterprise paywalls.

So we built FairTradeWorker.

### What is it?

FairTradeWorker is an **Intelligence API platform** for home services. We have 50+ endpoints covering:

🔨 **Job Intelligence** - AI analyzes photos/videos to generate scope & quotes
💰 **Pricing APIs** - Real-time market rates, competitive analysis, profit optimization
👷 **Contractor Matching** - Find the right contractor based on skills, location, reviews
🗺️ **Territory Intelligence** - Demand heatmaps, route optimization, market forecasting

### The Magic: Self-Learning AI

Every API call makes the system smarter. Predictions start at ~82% accuracy and improve to 99%+ over time. This creates a compounding advantage—the more it's used, the better it gets.

### The Fair Trade Model

Unlike Thumbtack, Angi, or HomeAdvisor that charge contractors 15-30%, our model is different:
- **Workers pay ZERO fees** (they keep 92%)
- **8% goes to territory operators** who maintain quality
- **API revenue** funds the platform

This attracts the best contractors while creating sustainable economics.

### Pricing

- **Free**: 100 API calls/month
- **Professional**: $97/month - 10,000 calls, all endpoints
- **Enterprise**: $497/month - Unlimited calls, Capital Intelligence APIs

### Built by Contractors, For Everyone

I know what it's like to lose 20% of a paycheck to platform fees. That's why we built this differently.

## First Comment

Hey everyone! 👋 Alex here, co-founder of FairTradeWorker.

Before I learned to code, I was a roofing contractor for 15 years. I've seen firsthand how broken the home services industry is:

- Platforms like Thumbtack charge $20-60 per LEAD (not even a job)
- HomeAdvisor takes 15-25% of every project
- The best contractors leave because fees eat their margins
- Homeowners end up paying more because contractors bake fees into quotes

We built FairTradeWorker with a radical premise: **what if workers paid zero fees?**

Our Fair Trade model:
- Homeowners pay the project cost
- 92% goes directly to workers
- 8% funds territory operators (local quality control)
- API subscriptions fund the platform

And the AI? It's not hype. Every prediction improves with real outcomes. Our Instant Quote API started at 82% accuracy 18 months ago. Today it's at 97.3%. That's the learning loop in action.

Happy to answer any questions about:
- The technical architecture (Python/FastAPI + custom ML models)
- How we trained on 2M+ historical jobs
- The economics of Fair Trade vs. traditional platforms
- Why we focused on APIs first (hint: B2B ➡️ B2C)

Also, if you're a contractor or know one, I'd love feedback! DM me. 🙏
