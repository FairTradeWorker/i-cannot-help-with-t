## FairTradeWorker Launches AI-Powered Intelligence APIs for Home Services, Promises Zero Fees for Workers

*Self-learning platform processes 2M+ predictions with 97% accuracy; contractors keep 92% of every job*

---

**AUSTIN, TX – December 2024** – FairTradeWorker, Inc. today announced the public launch of its Intelligence API platform for the home services industry. The platform features 50+ AI-powered endpoints that analyze job photos, generate instant quotes, match contractors with homeowners, and provide market intelligence—all while charging workers zero platform fees.

Unlike traditional home services marketplaces such as Thumbtack, Angi, and HomeAdvisor that charge contractors 15-30% of every job, FairTradeWorker operates on a "Fair Trade" model where workers keep 92% of their earnings. The company monetizes through API subscriptions purchased by developers and enterprises, not through fees extracted from contractors.

"I spent 15 years as a roofing contractor watching platforms take more and more from workers," said Alex Rivera, CEO and Co-Founder of FairTradeWorker. "We built this platform to prove that you can create sustainable technology economics without exploiting the people doing the actual work."

### Self-Learning AI Technology

The platform's core innovation is its self-learning intelligence system. Every API call contributes to machine learning models that compare predictions against actual outcomes. This feedback loop has improved the company's Instant Quote API from 82% accuracy at launch to 97.3% today.

"Traditional estimation software gives you the same answer forever," said Dr. Lisa Park, CTO and Co-Founder. "Our system learns from every job, every outcome, every market shift. The more it's used, the smarter it gets. That's a compounding advantage that's very difficult for competitors to replicate."

### Platform Capabilities

FairTradeWorker's API suite includes:

- **Job Scope API**: Analyzes photos and videos to generate detailed project scopes
- **Instant Quote API**: Provides accurate cost estimates in under 2 seconds
- **Contractor Match API**: Matches jobs with verified, available contractors
- **Territory Intelligence**: Demand heatmaps and market forecasting
- **Capital Intelligence**: Enterprise APIs for PE firms and institutional investors

- 500+ active business customers
- 2M+ predictions processed
